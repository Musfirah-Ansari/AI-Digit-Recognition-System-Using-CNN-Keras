# AI-Digit-Recognition-System-Using-CNN-Keras
## SUMMARY
MNIST dataset has been used in this project for the implementation of a handwritten digit
recognition with 10-digit classes from (0-9). To implement this, a special type of deep neural
network called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been used. In the end, we have
also built a Graphical user interface (GUI) where we can directly test it by drawing the digit
and recognizing it straight away.
